# Code used to fit the QA'ed SST data to a three-racer ex-Gaussian distribution (EXG3). 

# the EXG3 is cognitive modelling paradigm that estimates separate parameters (mu, sigma & tau) for the following:

1. Correct Go-trial responses
2. Incorrect Go-trial responses
3. SSRTs on Stop-trials

# In addition, the exg3 also models the
# probability of trigger failures (instances where the 'stop' process is not triggered on Stop-trials) and
# go failures (omissions on go-trials)

# All 11 parameters were estimated for each subject


# Further, we excluded participants that reported no go errors (i.e., 100% accuracy on go trials)
# to ensure that go mismatch parameters could be adequately estimated in our model.

# Longitudinal-SST-analysis

Contains code for conducting Bayesian parametric estimation of Stop-signal task data in R. Requires the Dynamic Models of Choice package (https://osf.io/pbwx8/).

This analysis forms part of a larger project involving data from the Neuroimaging of the Children's Attention Project (NICAP; https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0770-4).

The workflow is as follows: 

1. EXG3_DataPrep (Calculating traditional SSRT using ANALYZE-IT and prepping raw data for EXG3 Modelling)
2. EXG3_QA (QA and filterting of raw SST data)
3. EXG3_Modelling (Fitting QA'ed SST data to EXG3)
4. EXG3_MCMC (MCMC sampling of EXG3-fitted data to obtain subject-level posterior distributions for each parameter)
5. EXG3_Plotting (Plotting of posterior distributions)
6. EXG3_PostPred (Goodness-of-fit tests between the modelled and the observed data)

This analysis workflow employs the three-racer Ex-Gaussian Modelling paradigm deveopled by Prof. Dora Matzke and colleagues (2019) See link to the original publication: https://content.apa.org/record/2018-66881-003.
